Problem Statement:

Display all the details of the employees who did not work at any job in the past.

Return all the columns from the employee's table.




Return the columns 'employee_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'salary'.
Use the employees table.

STEP 1: Select employee_id and salary from the employee’s table.

select employee_id, salary from employees;

STEP 2: Based on the salary column divide the employees into three different categories as specified using the CASE function.

Salary greater than 20,000 as 'Class A'
Salary between 10,000 to 20,000 as 'Class B'
Salary less than 10,000 as 'Class C'.
End the condition as ‘Salary_bin’ which creates a new column as ‘Salary_bin’.

select employee_id, salary, 
case 
when salary > 20000 then 'Class A' 
when salary <=20000 and salary >=10000 then 'Class B' 
when salary < 10000 then 'Class C' 
end as Salary_bin from employees

STEP 1: Select employee_id, first_name, and last_name columns from the employees table.

STEP 2: To filter the records of the employees who have a manager working in the department that is US based, we need to use an Inner Join and join the employees table with itself with a different alias.
Now, we compare the manager_id from the first employees table with the employee_id of the second employees table.

STEP 3: Using an Inner Join, join the employees and departments tables on department_id. Inner join because we need to filter the common records from employees and departments.

STEP 4: Using an Inner Join, join the departments and locations tables on location_id. Inner join because we need to filter the common records from departments and locations.

STEP 5: To filter the records that are ‘US-based’, in the WHERE clause, use the ‘=’ operator on the country_id column.

STEP 6: Use ORDER BY on the employee_id column to display the details in ascending order of their ids.
